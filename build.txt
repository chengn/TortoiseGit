\section Introduction Introduction
Compiling TortoiseGit is not very difficult, but it requires several steps
to finish, at least the first time.

Unlike other big open source projects, once you have built all the libraries
TortoiseGit depends on, you can use the familiar VisualStudio IDE to build
and debug the binaries. No need to run the build script for every little change.

So don't give up if you read through the next section and all the requirements.
You only have to do this once.

\section Requirements Requirements

\subsection Requirements1 First, you need to install the compiler package.

-# You need VS2010 with SP1 (or at least Visual C++ 2010) to allow
   building of the full TortoiseGit package. 
   This is the recommended option, but it is not free :-(
   If you want to build the msi make sure the "Tools for Redistributing
   Applications" are installed.
-# If you do not have access to VS you can download the free
   Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition.
   This will allow you to build some of the libraries and the
   TortoiseUDiff, TortoiseIDiff and ResText projects only. You can not build the main parts of
   TortoiseGit (shell extension, TortoiseProc, TGitCache, TortoiseMerge, TortoiseGitBlame, ...)
   with the Express Edition!
   - Install Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition.
     Download it from http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/
   - Install MASM 6.15 from: http://win32assembly.online.fr/files/masm615.zip
     and add it to the PATH environment variable
   \note Do not bother to install WiX as you cannot build very much.
-# If you plan to build 64 bit packages, install the package 
   - "Language Tools" -> "Visual C++" -> "X64 Compilers and Tools" 
     available in the VS2010 Professional and higher. 
     This will provide you with a cross-compiler and a suitable 
     command shell.
-# \b Optional: Install the MSDN Library (documentation) from
   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=B8704100-0127-4D88-9B5D-896B9B388313
   You can always access it online at http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/Library

\subsection Requirements2 Next you need to install some utilities/programs.
- WiX(\b 1)                   http://wix.sourceforge.net
.
(\b 1) Above 3.5 version

\section get external source code
git submodule update --init

\section build32 Building the packages

Open TortoiseGit.sln
Build all projects.

\section Create MSI Package

Before create MSI Package, you need build tortoisegit release version (Win32 before x64).

Then
Build WixSetup
